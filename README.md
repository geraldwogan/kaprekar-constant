***Sample Run***
- 319 -------------> [Pick any 3 digit number (3 digits can't all be the same)]
- 931 -------------> [Order digits from largest to smallest]
- 931 - 139 = 792 -> [Subtract the reverse of this number]
- Repeat until the answer is 495

- 792 -------------> [Pick any 3 digit number (3 digits can't all be the same)]
- 972 -------------> [Order digits from largest to smallest]
- 972 - 279 = 693 -> [Subtract the reverse of this number]

- 693 -------------> [Pick any 3 digit number (3 digits can't all be the same)]
- 963 -------------> [Order digits from largest to smallest]
- 963 - 369 = 594 -> [Subtract the reverse of this number]

- 594 -------------> [Pick any 3 digit number (3 digits can't all be the same)]
- 954 -------------> [Order digits from largest to smallest]
- 954 - 459 = 495!! -> [Subtract the reverse of this number]
